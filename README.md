# Unity
This is a header only library meant to help manage and abstract away cuda memory transfers. Many of the implemented 
resemble features of std::vector. Submission of issues for added functionality or bugs is encouraged. 

# Usage and Documentation
Doxygen comments are all over the header, so look at Unity.cuh or one of the examples in the test folder.
